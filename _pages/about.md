Hello, I am Bhuwan Adhikari. I used to like reading, writing and fiddling with things. But I dont do that anymore, there is nothing that's specific and permanent in me, I have been realizing that everything changes with time. 

I am working as a software developer for quite a bit of time, developing mobile/web applications. I am thinking of documenting some of the things of my life here in these blogs. I have several stuff in my head but I am trying to put them in words post them here.

If you want to get connected, write me in <b>Contact</b> page.
